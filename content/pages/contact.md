      To use your Dabaratus, click and hold the devices button to dispense the desired amount of oil. For best results, we recommend using the device with room temperature oil. If you are in cold conditions, you can prime the device by running it under warm water.


      The Dabaratus is a clean, one-click solution for dabbing cannabis oil in a variety of different ways. The heat resistant metal tip allows you to dab directly on a nail or banger, the dispenser is also great for lining and blunt, wrapping a joint or topping a bowl.


      With the Dabaratus’s fully activated oil, you can use the Dabaratus almost anywhere. Check out a video on some different ways to use the Dabaratus here: Using the Dabartus. You can also learn more about the Dabaratus and why we made it here.
